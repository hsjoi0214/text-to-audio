By the 13th century, India had earned the title of the“Golden Bird”, renowned for its immense prosperity and thriving trade routes that connected it with civilisations like Rome and Greece. This trade facilitated not just commerce, but also the exchange of culture, religion, and philosophy. The writings of Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE), Megasthenes (ca. 350–290 BCE), and Aristobulus (ca. 375–301 BCE) offer detailed accounts of India’s wealth, culture, and wisdom. Pliny marvelled at the wealth flowing into India through trade, while Megasthenes documented the splendour of the city of Pataliputra and its highly organised society.

Many Roman gods, like Mithra were influenced by Indian mythology, reflecting India’s profound cultural impact. Moreover, Indian schools of thought, such as Nyaya and Vaisheshika, focused on logic and epistemology, influencing philosophical traditions worldwide. Bhaskara’s work on infinity, along with other Indian ideas, traveled to the Arab world and later Europe. Even scholars like Schopenhauer praised Indian texts, viewing the Upanishads and Vedas as treasures of wisdom and philosophy. Early Arab scholars were in awe of India’s intellectual and cultural richness. Prominent Muslim writers like Al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) , Al-Mas’udi (c. 896–956 CE) and Al-Idrisi (1100–1165/66 CE), often praising India as a beacon of high culture and refined philosophy. Al-Biruni admired the sophistication of Indian astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. He translated Indian texts into Arabic and introduced Indian numerals (which later became known as Arabic numerals) to the Islamic world.
