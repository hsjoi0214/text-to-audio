Hinduism teaches that by attaining the ultimate realisation of the illusory nature of this world, we can unveil the clouds of ignorance that obscure our understanding. This awakening allows us to see the world for what it truly isâ€”a divine play, a temporary manifestation of deeper, spiritual forces. By recognising the fleeting satisfaction that sensory pleasures bring, and by discovering our true nature, we can embark on the path to eternal bliss and profound contentment.
