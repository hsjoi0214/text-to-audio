India’s leadership during global crises has been exemplary as well. During the COVID-19pandemic, India provided millions of doses of its homegrown covid vaccines to around 100 countries, many of them in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. India’s humanitarian efforts are equally notable, from being one of the first responders to the Nepal earthquake and the Mozambique cyclone to aiding its neighbour, Turkey and many more.
