Once the richest trading nation in the world, India was banned from global commerce under British rule. Its resources, from precious minerals to coal and timber were shipped to Britain, while profits lined the pockets of British industrialists. Meanwhile, millions of Indians were sent as indentured labourers to British colonies, working under harsh conditions to enrich the Empire. It is estimated that Britain drained India of $45 trillion—a staggering figure that overshadows even the current U.S. GDP of $23 trillion.

This tale of exploitation was made easier by the fragmentation of India’s intellectual elite. Instead of rallying the country under a common vision, they were divided and focused on personal ambitions. Even after independence, this division persisted. India’s intellectuals, broken by years of colonisation, often lacked the self-confidence to lead the nation back to its former glory. Many became tools of foreign influence, placing personal financial gain above the nation’s collective interest.
