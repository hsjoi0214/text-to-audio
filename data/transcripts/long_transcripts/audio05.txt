By breaking free from desire, we consciously disrupt the cycle of cause and effect. Without a cause, there is no effect, and in this absence, a deep sense of calm settles upon the mind. This ancient path also aligns with the concept of reincarnation, echoing the law of conservation of energy—energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. Desire, according to these teachings, acts as the catalyst for this perpetual cycle of transformation. It is the craving within us that fuels the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This unfulfilled yearning propels the mind, compelling it to seek fulfilment—even at life’s final moments.
