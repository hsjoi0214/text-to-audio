Rather than seeking grand revelations, we are reminded to appreciate the beauty of the present moment, realising that it, too, holds the sacred. In this way, the spiritual journey is not about striving for something beyond us, but about opening ourselves to the richness already present in every breath, every encounter, and every experience.
