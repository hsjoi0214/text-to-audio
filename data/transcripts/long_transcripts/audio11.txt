Play of the divine,’ it is known, according to the world’s oldest religion, Hinduism—timeless wisdom that has endured for thousands of years. The philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, as taught by Shankara, offers a profound and almost unchallengeable understanding of existence. If you reflect deeply, you may find yourself arriving at the same conclusions that Shankara reached centuries ago, echoing the teachings of the ancient Vedas, some of the oldest texts in human history. Interestingly, wise figures like Ibn Arabi, Meister Eckhart and many more from different parts of the world arrived at similar insights.
