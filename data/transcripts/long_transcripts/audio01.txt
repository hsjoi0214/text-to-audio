The teachings of this ancient path are rooted in the belief that the ultimate goal of sentient life is the attainment of Moksha, often referred to as Nirvana in Buddhism, which means liberation. This liberation signifies freedom from the endless cycle of birth and death—the ceasing of the constant flux of energies within this closed system of existence. The ending of the cause-effect system that we constantly find ourselves in. The goal is to return to one’s true state: a state of oneness, where one becomes the impartial observer, untouched by the turbulence of life.
