What was that conclusion? If I had to summarise the essence of this religion, it could be done in a single word: ‘Singularity’. This concept, or the meaning behind it, has evolved throughout the history of this ancient religion. It has been known by many names— The Fourth, Turiya, Brahman, Mahat, Sita-Ram, Radha-Krishna, Shakti-Shiv—each reflecting different aspects of the same idea. So, what is the message? The message is simple: only a seed can give birth to a tree. Without the seed, the tree cannot exist. This seed represents the singularity they speak of—a perfect, unifying force that unfolded into a self-sustaining, diverse system, manifesting itself in many forms.
