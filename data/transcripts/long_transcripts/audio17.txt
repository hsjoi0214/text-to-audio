India’s history is a mix of brilliance and profound sadness—a land that was once a cradle of ideas and philosophy, nurturing great minds like  Brahmagupta and Aryabhata. Among the first six seed civilisations of human history namely Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, Norte Chico and the Olmec civilisation, the Indian civilisation stands as the most ancient, with newly excavated sites like Rakhigarhi pushing the origins of the Indus Valley Civilisation as far back as 7000 BCE. Remarkably, India is the one of the only two among these oldest civilisations that still thrives today.
