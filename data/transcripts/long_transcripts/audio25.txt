During times of crisis around the world , India has also become a dominant force in global diplomacy. The Delhi-Declaration at the G20 summit in 2024, which successfully included the African-Union as a permanent member, stands as a landmark achievement highlighting India’s role in reshaping international alliances and enabling Africa to have a voice in the global affairs. India is also one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions, having deployed over 250,000 troops in various global conflicts. Approximately 80% of the world’s maritime trade, including 40% of the global oil trade, passes through the Indian Ocean. This region is prone to piracy, maritime crime, terrorism, natural disasters, and resource competition, making it a hotspot for security concerns. Therefore, India serves as a natural security partner for various countries, ensuring stability in key areas around the Indian Ocean. With its strategic location and growing naval capabilities, India plays a pivotal role in safeguarding these crucial maritime routes and promoting safe and free navigation for all nations.
