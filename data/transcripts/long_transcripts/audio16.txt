Energy fascinates me deeply! In one way or another, everything—sentient or non-sentient—is made up of energy. Whether or not we believe in the concept of reincarnation, the interaction of energy throughout the cosmos is something we can hardly overlook. The laws of thermodynamics stare us in the face, telling a story of birth and death, growth and decay, and the transformation of energy from one form to another.
