Brahman is everything—good, bad, or ugly—and this physical manifestation of ours is no exception. Thoughts, desires, and the interplay of cause and effect are simply the ways through which this singular reality experiences itself in various forms. As I see it, there is no need to reject desires or the physical world to embrace the spiritual truth. I no longer make a distinction between having desires and being free of them. I place the same value on the physical as I do on the subtle. This realisation liberates me from the need to chase spiritual experiences or meditative states as proof of something “beyond.”
