Therefore it my strong belief supported by archeological and genetic findings that these ancestors are ours—yours and mine—and their wisdom is a gift to us. It is the responsibility of each generation to leave the world better than they found it for their children, and this is precisely what our ancestors did for us. They discovered universal truths and passed them down to us, providing a foundation for future societies based on love and respect for all forms of life.
