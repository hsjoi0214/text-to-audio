India’s cultural influence is both profound and far-reaching. As one of the world’s oldest continuous civilisations, its religious and philosophical traditions have deeply shaped much of Asia. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Tibet and Japan have embraced key elements of Hinduism and Buddhism, both of which originated in India. Today, India’s spiritual, artistic, and philosophical heritage continues to inspire people and societies across the globe.
