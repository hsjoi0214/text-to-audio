Because I resonate deeply with this belief, I no longer see the physical world or desires as separate from that singularity. I no longer yearn for subtle experiences or have preferences regarding what energy I might transform into after death. The cycle of birth, death, or rebirth, therefore becomes redundant for me, when everything is an expression of Brahman. I accept it all with grace, welcoming every form it takes.
