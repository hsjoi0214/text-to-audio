Often depicted by Western media as unsafe, polluted, and chaotic—a legacy of centuries of colonial exploitation—these perceptions, in my view, are far from being India’s greatest challenges and merely shows superficial issues which I often call as ‘cosmetic concerns’. History is full of examples like Singapore, Dubai, China, South Korea, and post-war Germany, where rapid infrastructure transformation was achieved when driven by national willpower and a solid economic foundation. While the scale of India is vastly different, and it’s not entirely fair to compare it with smaller, US-funded post-war countries, the core principle remains valid: Nations can rebuild when driven by determination.
