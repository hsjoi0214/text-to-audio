A key teaching of ancient wisdom revolves around the role of desire. True liberation, or Moksha, can only be achieved by extinguishing desire itself. When we transcend our endless cravings, we begin to recognise that all life—sentient or non-sentient—springs from the same source. Everything is interconnected, everything is one. In this realisation lies the gateway to lasting liberation. Essentially, desire becomes the key to both happiness and suffering. When desire ceases, so does the relentless thirst of this world.
