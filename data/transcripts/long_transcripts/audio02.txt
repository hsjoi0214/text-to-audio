In Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, the physical state of being is often associated with suffering. The Buddha referred to this world as “Dukkha,” meaning sorrow or suffering. From the moment of birth, sentient beings are on an inevitable journey of decay—we age, we fall ill, we experience emotional turmoil. We are creatures bound by habits, always grasping at anything to fill the inherent emptiness of our existence. This is not a statement of pessimism, but of reality. It is precisely this realisation that calls us to rise above the fleeting pleasures and pains of life.
