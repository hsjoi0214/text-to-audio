India being a non-aligned neutral actor advocates for dialogue and diplomacy, rather than taking sides or fuelling the conflict. Prime Minister Modi’s back-and-forth meetings with both President Zelensky and President Putin are significant indicators of this leadership. In June, Modi met with Zelensky, followed by a meeting with Putin in July. This was then followed by another meeting with Zelensky in August and once again with Putin in September. These successive, high-level engagements show India’s evolving diplomatic reach and its commitment to encouraging peaceful resolution through dialogue exchange. Unfortunately western media will have a very hard time showing this side of India, I guess over-populated trains make for more views.
